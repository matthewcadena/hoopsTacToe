# Hoops-Tac-Toe

## Description
This project aims to create a fun, battle-of-wits style NBA trivia game. Inspired by the 
[Hoop Grid](https://hoopgrids.com/) trivia game and [Tiki-Taka-Toe](https://playfootball.games/footy-tic-tac-toe), 
I created it over winter break of 2023 so that my friends could show off their ball knowledge against each other. 

## Usage

I'm still working on an installation guide. I created the game with my friends in mind,
but I'd love to open it up for more widespread use in the near future. In the meantime, you can view the game in action 
[here](https://youtube.com) or explore the codebase here on GitHub.

## Contributing
